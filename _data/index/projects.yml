  desc: 3D Vision course project, ETH ZÃ¼rich (Spring 2021). The project was supervised by Google Research Interns. The goal of this project is to use an online adaptation module to overcome the domain shift  issue in dense reconstruction and build a fully differentiable SLAM pipeline that can be optimized End-2-End. We propose to combine the SLAM framework of GradSLAM with a self-supervised depth prediction network, to optimize a SLAM pipeline for real-time dense reconstruction on totally unseen scenes.
