- name: Learning to Generate Events using Spiking Neural Networks
  i18n: jalpc
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/learning_to_generate_events.jpg
  desc: Semester Project with the Robotics and Perception Group (RPG), under the supervision of Professor Davide Scaramuzza and the PhD students Daniel Gehrig and Mathias Gehrig. The goal of the project is to design a learning-based solution that converts any existing video dataset recorded with conventional cameras to synthetic event data, using Spiking Neural Networks, which process information conveyed as temporal spikes.

- name: Instinctive Robot Control via Hololens2
  i18n: jalpc
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/HOLOLENS-2.jpg
  desc: Mixed Reality course project, ETH Zürich (Fall 2021). The goal of the project is to develop an intuitive mixed reality interface on a Microsoft Hololens 2, with which the user should be able to remotely control a robot arm and perform basic assembly tasks using hand and eye tracking. The project requires the use of C#/Unity/MRTK for interfacing with the HL2, ROS for tele-communicating with the physical robot and OpenCV for estimating objects poses in the physical environment and mapping them to the MR environment of the user.

  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: ivanalberico
  repo: End-To-End-Self-Supervised-SLAM
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/end2endSSS.png
  desc: 3D Vision course project, ETH Zürich (Spring 2021). The project was supervised by Google Research Interns. The goal of this project is to use an online adaptation module to overcome the domain shift  issue in dense reconstruction and build a fully differentiable SLAM pipeline that can be optimized End-2-End.

- name: Multi-task learning for semantics and depth
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: ivanalberico
  repo: Deep-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving-ETH
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/multi-task-learning.png
  desc: Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving course project, ETH Zürich (Spring 2021). The goal of the project is to build Multi-Task Learning (MTL) architectures for dense prediction tasks, i.e. semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation in autonomous driving scenes, exploiting joint architectures, branched architectures, and task distillation.

- name: 3D Object Detection from Lidar Point Clouds
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: ivanalberico
  repo: Deep-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving-ETH
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/3D_object_detection.png
  desc: Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving course project, ETH Zürich (Spring 2021). The goal of the project is to build a 2-stage 3D object detector to detect vehicles in autonomous driving scenes, i.e. drawing 3D bounding boxes around each vehicle. Irregular 3D point cloud data are exploited to detect vehicles.

- name: SkaterBlob game on Unity3D
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: ivanalberico
  repo: Virtual-Reality1-ETH-SkaterBlobGame
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/skaterBlob.png
  desc: Virtual Reality I course project, ETH Zürich (Spring 2021). The project consists in the implementation of a skateboarding game using Unity3D and Blender. The game contains different levels with increasing difficulty and the whole level design is implemented in C# with Unity interface. All the assets and animations were modeled on Blender.

- name: Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filter
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: ivanalberico
  repo: Recursive-Estimation-ETH
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/projects_imgs/Robot-navigation.jpg
  desc: Recursive Estimation course project, ETH Zürich (Spring 2021). The project consists in the implementation of an Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the multiple states of a boat system and implementation of a Particle Filter to localize a robot in a partially known environment.
